# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
## About Me
Hello! I'm a robotics student who is currently diving into the world of deep learning and MLOps. My journey started with robotics and supervised learning , but I'm now expanding my skills into deep learning and LLM's. This GitHub profile is a place where I share my projects, experiments, and learning experiences as I grow my knowledge in both robotics and ML / AI.

# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
## About Me
Hello! I'm a robotics student who is currently diving into the world of deep learning. My journey started with robotics and supervised learning , but I'm now expanding my skills into deep learning with Tensorflow and Pytorch. This GitHub profile is a place where I share my projects, experiments, and learning experiences as I grow my knowledge in both robotics and ML / AI.

## My Skills
### Robotics
- Microcontrollers: Experience with STM32, Arduino
- Programming Languages: Proficient in C, C++, and Python.
- OS : Linux, Windows
- Frameworks : Robot Operating System

### Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn : for supervised learning algorithms
-  Tensorflow, PyTorch and Keras : for deep learning
- spaCy : for natural language processing

## Learning Goals :
I am constantly learning and looking to expand my knowledge in the following areas:
- Deep learning techniques with neural networks
- Reinforcment learning
- ML Ops

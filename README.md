# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
## About Me
Hello! I'm a robotics student who is currently diving into the world of web development. My journey started with robotics and embedded systems, but I'm now expanding my skills into front-end development with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. This GitHub profile is a place where I share my projects, experiments, and learning experiences as I grow my knowledge in both robotics and web development.

## My Skills
### Robotics and Machnine Learning 
- Microcontrollers: Experience with STM, Arduino
- Programming Languages: Proficient in C, C++, and Python.
- Frameworks : Scikit-Learn, Robot Operating System

### Web Development
- JavaScript : Building interactive and dynamic web applications
- TypeScirpt : Writing type-safe JavaScript code for better maintainability.

## Learning Goals :
I am constantly learning and looking to expand my knowledge in the following areas:
- Advanced JavaScript and TypeScript concepts
- Deepening my understanding of React and its ecosystem (Redux, React Router, etc..)
- Exploring backend development with Node.js and Express
- Exploring more frontend technology
